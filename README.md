# Dental X-ray Binary Impacted Tooth Classifier

Disclaimer: This is for learning/experimentation only — **not** medical advice and **not** a diagnostic tool.

Tiny PyTorch project that trains a binary classifier on dental X-rays to predict:

- `impacted_binary = 1` → impacted
- `impacted_binary = 0` → not impacted

CSV-driven pipeline + a pretrained ResNet-18.

## Dataset

Source: Kaggle — Dental Xrays  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ifrashabbir002/dental-xrays

Notes:
- The dataset is imbalanced (~13% positives), so training uses `pos_weight` in `BCEWithLogitsLoss`.
- Please check the Kaggle page for the dataset’s license/terms.
- This repo does **not** include the dataset files.
